# Python-AHRS-Visualization
AHRS Visualization implemented in Python 3x.  Data is from Arduino Nano BLE Sense w/ LSM9DS1 via serial port.
We use the pitch, roll, and yaw values to create a visualization which updates on a loop.

Visualization is based on Kevin Pololu's MinIMU-9-test which is based on sf9domahrs by Doug Weibel and Jose Julio, which is in turn based on ArduIMU v1.5 by Jordi Munoz, William Premerlani, Jose Julio, and Doug Weibel.
